# FlightGrouperApp
Avatar: Flight of Passage Grouper App

The original Avatar: Flight of Passage Grouper App was created by Carter Lewellyn and served the purpose of helping the grouper cast member track incoming guests and assign them to seats being careful not to over fill or under fill a room of 16 link chairs. The design was simple, but hard to keep track of seats that were out of commission.

This new version gives a better visual representation of the seating with the partition shown. Also, the downed seats are stored until the page is completely refreshed. One can move from on grouper to another. the drawing over the seats has also been improved upon with multiple colors and even an alternating rainbow effect. One can also choose how thin or thin k the stroke is and the amount of opacity. The addition of a keypad makes keeping track of upcoming guests easier. The color scheme is intended to match the Link Chamber and preshow videos.

## Future versions
1. Show seating arrangement upon command (toggle switch) - For guests to see layout of room
2. Show just number dots and not the full seat
3. Creation of seats in objects with name and status as variables
4. Utilize local storage for saving and recalling seats that are out of commission
5. Make page more responsive to other types of media (other than tablets)
6. Fix buttons to be more rounded and eye-friendly
